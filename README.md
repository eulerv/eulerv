# üëã Hello, I'm Euler Vicente!
I'm a passionate backend developer with a deep interest in a wide range of technologies. From Java development to experimenting with frontend frameworks like Next.js, Tailwind, and Framer Motion, I'm always up  to learn!

Well, I've been obsessed with technology since I was born. Besides Java development, I can also code something basic with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the frameworks I've mentioned. And I understand the basics of hooks and HTTP requests too, for build visual interfaces required to show my APIs running better (even though swagger do kind of this).

I like to read something when the time allows me to, and well, I've never done a pull request, could it be in your company? üòâ
